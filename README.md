# File Sharing Frontend

This is a primary frontend part for the application.

## Contribution

- Go to `develop` branch and pull the latest version
- Create a branch with the name `feature/your-feature-name` from `develop`. The first part is type that can be 'feature', 'fix' or 'docs'
- Code, lint, commit and push into new branch
- For commit messages, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Commit message should be short, but add more text to the body if there is something to explain about this commit. For ex check [commit history of React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3621606c4486051de8b443c443cd87f6b822d1a0)
- Here is a good [article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) about making Git commit messages
- If you're branch gets outdated (new commits in `develop`), please rebase it, not merge
- Create a PR with the detailed description and photo/video if needed. Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the description for your PR
- Get approval
- Close PR via `Squash and merge`. Do not merge without approval (by at least 1 team member of your profession). Cross-review between team members (peer review) must be present.
- Delete branch
- Check it on staging as soon as it is deployed (connect Slack to Github to get notification)
